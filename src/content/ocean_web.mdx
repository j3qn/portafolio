Ocean is a ScreenShare tool launched on April 4, 2023.<br></br><br></br>

It began as a leisure project by three friends. It started as a free Minecraft-based ScreenShare Tool, made in Flask, Python, HTML, Tailwind, and Sqlite.<br></br><br></br>

The ScreenShare Tool became very popular and began to grow rapidly, expanding to games such as Minecraft Bedrock, Rust, and its main game, GTA V (FiveM).<br></br><br></br>

Currently, Ocean is one of the most important tools for protecting gaming servers for various games. It has thousands of detections, hundreds of clients, and constant updates.<br></br><br></br><br></br>



My work at Ocean initially began as a full-stack developer. At first, I developed the dashboard (using the aforementioned technologies) and the front-end. Currently, my work at Ocean is more focused on the front-end and product design using technologies such as Figma, React/Astro, Next.js, and Tailwind, developing landing pages, blogs, and dashboards.
