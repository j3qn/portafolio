Tango is a Hack Client made for Minecraft 1.8.9 compatible with different Launchers and clients.<br></br><br></br>

I was hired as a freelancer for this project, and my job was to create the entire website (Landing, Dashboard, and alternate pages).
<br></br><br></br>
In this project, I used Astro, Tailwindcss, and React components for the frontend.
<br></br><br></br>
I also used Flask (Python) and SQLite for the backend.
